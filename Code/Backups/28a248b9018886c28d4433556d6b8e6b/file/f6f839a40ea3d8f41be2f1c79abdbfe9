	// Place your VS_Markdown 工作区 snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	/* "Print to console": {
		"scope": "javascript,typescript,markdown",
		"prefix": "log",
		"body": [
			"console.log('$1');",
	 		"$2"
	 	],
	 	"description": "Log output to console"
	 },*/

	"code block":{
		"scope": "markdown,cpp,javascript",
		"prefix": "```,",
		"body": ["```$1",
			"$2",
			"```",
			"$3"],
	}
